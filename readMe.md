Train Time Activity

In this activity I created a log for users to input a train name, destination, frequency of the train
and how many minutes away the train is. Once submit is clicked each of these are sent to a firebase storage 
as well as displayed for you on the screen. The table also displays an updated arrival time.

Getting Started: In order to access this Table you will need a working computer as well as the website it is located at.
